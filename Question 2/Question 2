Collect data (images) and annotate them for two classes: Person and vehicle. You may use
platforms such as LabelImg for annotations. You may limit to 800 images for the dataset. Perform
object detection on your collected dataset and find the mean distance between the two classes
in each image. You may use YOLOv5 for detection.
