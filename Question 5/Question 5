To test ability to comprehend new frameworks and ability to write necessary wrappers:
• Download the pytorch check point file from here (link to be added) and convert the file to .onnx
• Perform inferences on an onnx runtime session.
• Write a wrapper to perform the inference on video feed from webcam.
• Relevant papers to the .pth file:
• Real-time 2D Multi-Person Pose Estimation on CPU: Lightweight OpenPose
• Single-Shot Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation From Monocular RGB
